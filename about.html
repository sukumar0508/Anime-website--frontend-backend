 drama, historical, horror, mystery, romance, science<br>
 fiction and fantasy, erotica (hentai and ecchi), sports and games, and suspense, <br>
among others.[4][5] Many manga are translated into other languages.[6]<br>

Since the 1950s, manga has become an increasingly major part of the Japanese publishing industry<br>.[7]
 By 1995, the manga market in Japan was valued at ¥586.<br>4 billion ($6–7 billion),[8] with annual sales 
of 1.9 billion manga books and manga magazines in Japan (equivalent to 15 issues per person).<br>

growth of digital manga sales as well as increase of print sales.<br>[10][11] In 2022 Japan's
 manga market hit yet another record value of ¥675.<br>9 billion.[12][13] Manga have also
